# Introduction
goviaji is a programming language in development. The main design goal is to allow easy definitions of other programming languages, making it a kind of meta language. The syntax and semantics of the target language is defined in goviaji, then a program in that language is written also in goviaji. The goviaji interpreter can check the syntax of the program in the target language and execute it according to the target language semantics.

# Examples
The repository currently includes the following languages from the book "Types and Programming Languages" by Pierce:

 - Untyped arithmetics
 - Untyped lambda calculus
